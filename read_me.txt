My project is Chess. It can be played by one person (against the AI), or by two people who play against each other. The instructions for the game are incorporated in the game for those who don’t know how certain pieces move, etc. The AI works by using an algorithm called “minimax” to find the optimal move for the computer’s side, which the algorithm dictates to be the move which does the least amount of damage. A much more in-depth explanation of the algorithm is included in the project above the function “minimax.” There are no external libraries that need to be installed. I built everything from scratch and everything that is used in the project is either included with the python 3 download from python.org, or included in the .zip file I included. So, no downloads are necessary since these are very likely on your computer.
